In case you missed it, the yearly run of PHP Advent for 2009 included <a title="PHP Advent 2009 / Dæmonize Your PHP" href="http://phpadvent.org/2009/daemonize-your-php-by-sean-coates">an article</a> by <a title="Sean Coates: PHP, Web (+Beer)" href="http://seancoates.com/blogs/">Sean Coates</a>, an active contributor to the Phergie project. In this article, Sean describes his interesting use of <a title="Supervisor" href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisord</a>, a <a title="Python Programming Language -- Official Website" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>-based client/server system for monitoring *NIX processes, to run Phergie as a daemon. It's a wonderful read if you're looking for a way to run Phergie in the background without using <a title="GNU Screen - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">screen</a>.
