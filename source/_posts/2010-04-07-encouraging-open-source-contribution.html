Brandon Savage, who recently began contributing to the Phergie project, published <a title="Encouraging Open Source Contribution | BrandonSavage.net" href="http://www.brandonsavage.net/encouraging-open-source-contribution/">a blog post</a> today that spotlights the Phergie project as an example of good architecture and creating a low barrier to entry for prospective contributors. His kind words and evangelism of the project are appreciated as are the excellent points that he makes on the post's overarching topic.
