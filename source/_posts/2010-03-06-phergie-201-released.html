You'll notice that this web site now has a <a title="Changelog — Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/changelog/">Changelog</a> page, where you can view all information pertaining to our first maintenance release, 2.0.1.

In a nutshell, we had a few small feature additions, several bug fixes, and a large design issue that resulted in a few BC-breaking changes to fix something that was already broken and hopefully won't affect many plugins. Many thanks go out to people who have reported bugs and submitted patches; this project would not be what it is without your support.

On a related note, API documentation for the core is now available both online and in PEAR package form. A link to the <a title="API Documentation" href="http://phergie.org/api/">online version</a> and instructions to install a local copy via the Pirum server are both included on the <a title="Developers — Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/developers/">Developers</a> page.

Lastly, as you may have noticed from the logo in the right column of this web site, the Phergie project has been invited to participate in the new <a title="PHPWomen » OS Project Opportunities" href="http://www.phpwomen.org/wordpress/os-project-opportunities">PHPWomen Partnership Program</a>. We welcome any and all PHPWomen members who would like to participate in the Phergie project to join the #phergie channel on the Freenode IRC network, pick one of our <a title="Issues - elazar/phergie - GitHub" href="https://github.com/phergie/phergie/issues">many issue reports</a>, and start working with us to improve Phergie!
