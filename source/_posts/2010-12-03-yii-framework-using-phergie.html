The increasingly popular <a title="Yii Framework: Best for Web 2.0 Development" href="http://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii Framework</a> project recently <a title="YiiBot in irc.freenode.org #yii - Yii Framework Forum" href="http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php?/topic/13190-yiibot-in-ircfreenodeorg-yii/">implemented a Phergie bot</a>, which they've named YiiBot, in their #yii IRC channel on the <a title="About the Network" href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a> network. One of their developers, tydeas, has made a few appearances in the #phergie channel to ask questions and discuss Phergie. He has produced several custom Phergie plugins for use in YiiBot. We're very excited at this development and hope that the Yii project continues to use and extend Phergie, and perhaps even contribute some of their plugins back to the project!
