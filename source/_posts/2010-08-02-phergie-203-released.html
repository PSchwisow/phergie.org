My profound apologies for the even longer delay on this release — believe me, I felt it when putting together the changelog for it — but I'm elated to announce that Phergie 2.0.3 is now available. You can read about the many bug fixes and exciting new additions in this release on the <a title="Changelog — Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/changelog/">Changelog</a> page. With this release, we'll be attempting to replace the dated Phergie 1.x installation running on the Freenode network with this new 2.x release. Once again, our thanks go out to all of our users and contributors for their help in making the Phergie project a continued success!
