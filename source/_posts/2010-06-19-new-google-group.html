The Phergie project now has <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/phergie" title="Phergie | Google Groups">a Google Group</a>! Because not all users or developers frequent IRC, it was decided that some sort of mailing list medium was needed where users and developers can come together to discuss issues and potential new features as well as to offer support to the community. We hope you'll join and we thank you for your continued contributions.
