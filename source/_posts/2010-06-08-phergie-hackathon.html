<strong>Who</strong>: Everyone and anyone who loves Phergie and wants to help make her better!

<strong>What</strong>: The Phergie Hackathon

<strong>Where</strong>: The #phergie channel of the <a title="About the Network" href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode IRC network</a>

<strong>When</strong>: Saturday, June 19 from 10 AM <a title="Central Time Zone (North America) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Daylight_Time_(North_America)#Central_Daylight_Time">CDT</a> till the last person leaves

<strong>Why</strong>: We're gearing up for a 2.0.3 release and we're looking to knock out as many bugs as we can that currently block us from replacing the old Phergie 1.x instance currently running on Freenode with a 2.x instance.

<strong>How</strong>: Just show up in the IRC channel, pick a ticket from <a title="Issues - elazar/phergie - GitHub" href="https://github.com/phergie/phergie/issues">the laundry list</a>, and start hacking. Feel free to post any questions you may have to the channel. If you want to hit the ground running on the day of the Hackathon, decide what ticket you'd like to work on and take a look at the <a title="Developers - Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/developers/">developer docs</a> and <a title="elazar&#039;s phergie at master - GitHub" href="https://github.com/phergie/phergie">source code</a> beforehand.

Hope to see you there!
