Up until recently, the main web site for this project was constituted entirely by its Trac wiki on Assembla. Among other efforts going into the project's next major version, it was decided that it should have a web site with a bit more substance.

This new site will be used to announce future releases and showcase new plugins and other related content contributed by the community. It will also house pages for <a title="Users — Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/users/">user</a> and <a title="Developers — Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/developers/">developer</a> documentation.

In addition to the web site, version control and issue tracking have been migrated from <a title="Apache Subversion" href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> and <a title="Phergie - Trac" href="http://trac.assembla.com/phergie">Trac</a> on <a title="Welcome | Assembla" href="https://www.assembla.com/home">Assembla</a> to <a title="Git - Fast Version Control System" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a title="GitHub Issue Tracker! - GitHub" href="https://github.com/blog/411-github-issue-tracker">Github Issues</a> on <a title="Your Dashboard - GitHub" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. We're hoping this will make contributing to the project even easier.

Note that not all plugins from the 1.x branch have been ported yet, only those essential for basic functionality. We hope that you'll join us in the effort to complete this conversion by consulting the <a title="Issues - elazar/phergie - GitHub" href="https://github.com/phergie/phergie/issues">issue tracker</a> to see what remains to be done, forking the <a title="elazar&#039;s phergie at master - GitHub" href="https://github.com/elazar/phergie/">new git repository</a>, committing patches and additions, and submitting pull requests so we can import your work into the main repository.

We look forward to seeing what you do with Phergie 2.0!
