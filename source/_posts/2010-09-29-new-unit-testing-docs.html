The <a title="Developers — Phergie" href="http://phergie.org/developers/">Developers</a> page now includes <a title="Developers — Phergie" href="/developers/#Unit_Testing">a section</a> on unit testing Phergie plugins. Efforts to improve <a title="Chapter 15. Code Coverage Analysis" href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.4/en/code-coverage-analysis.html">code coverage</a> of the Phergie codebase continue, so if you'd like to help out, find a plugin lacking a unit test suite and write one. If you're developing your own plugins to contribute back to the project, try to include unit test suites for them when you submit them. Our continued thanks go out to all of our contributors.
