Thanks to the efforts of <a title="Funroe Â» Funroe" href="http://funroe.net">Jess Planck</a>, the Phergie project finally has a logo! You'll now see it sported in the page header on this web site. The colors of the image have been designed such that Phergie shirts are a definite possibility in the future. Please take a moment to send a shout out to Jess on <a title="Jess Planck (ev3rywh3re) on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/ev3rywh3re">Twitter</a> and thank him for his contribution!
