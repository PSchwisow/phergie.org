If you aren't familiar with it, the oddWeek Podcast is a great source of information on people and events in the PHP community at large. It's hosted by <a title="Blogs | CaseySoftware, LLC - Supporters &amp; Developers of web2project" href="http://caseysoftware.com/blog">Keith Casey</a> and <a title="Postcards From My Life" href="http://blog.calevans.com/">Cal Evans</a> of <a title="Blogs | Blue Parabola, LLC" href="http://blueparabola.com/">Blue Parabola</a>. The <a title="oddWeek Episode #4 | php|architect" href="http://www.phparch.com/2010/03/oddweek-episode-4/">most recent episode</a> of the podcast includes an interview with <a title="The Blog of ElizabethN" href="http://naramore.net/blog/">Elizabeth Naramore</a>, an active member of <a title="PHPWomen" href="http://www.phpwomen.org/">PHPWomen</a> who is recruiting for the new <a title="PHPWomen » Partnerships with OS Projects" href="http://www.phpwomen.org/wordpress/partnerships-with-os-projects">PHPWomen Partnership Program</a>. The Phergie project was recently solicited for membership in the program, which we happily accepted, and they were nice enough to give us a mention in the podcast. Check it out!
