## About

### History

Phergie is an open source IRC bot written in PHP 5. She was originally written to replace the Ai bot in the #phpc PHP Community channel on the Freenode network. The intention behind her development was to provide a bot with an open modern codebase to which patrons of the channel could contribute. Her popularity has grown over time and she now runs in a number of channels on Freenode.

### Statement of Diversity

The Phergie project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community is stronger and more vibrant. A diverse community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas.

Although we have phrased this statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific attributes that are used to discriminate against people. Some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, culture or subculture, national origin, political or religious affiliation, socio-economic status, and physical or mental difference. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.

_Disclaimer: This statement was heavily influenced by the <a href="http://www.python.org/community/diversity" target="_blank">Diversity Statement</a> from the  <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python project</a>._
